Description: The package is collection of functions that support teaching
    methods of estimating and testing time series factor models for use in
    robust portfolio construction and analysis. The fitting methods include
    both classical least squares, and modern robust model fitting methods
    which are not much influenced by outliers. The package functionality
    includes returns and risk decompositions of factor models into total,
    factors, and residuals components, with user choice of standard deviation,
    value-at-risk (VaR), or expected shortfall (ES) risk measures. The package
    is well-suited for use in a portfolio construction course, or a
    financial time series modeling and anlysis course, in a quantitative finance
    MS degree program.
