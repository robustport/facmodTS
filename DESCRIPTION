Description: Supports teaching methods of estimating and testing time series
    factor models for use in robust portfolio construction and analysis. Unique
    in providing not only classical least squares, but also modern robust model
    fitting methods which are not much influenced by outliers. Includes
    returns and risk decompositions, with user choice of  standard deviation,
    value-at-risk, and expected shortfall risk measures. "Robust Statistics
